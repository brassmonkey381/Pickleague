# Losers-Bracket Playoff Mechanics

This is the canonical reference for the **double-elimination (DE) playoff variants** in the 3-axis tournament format model:

- `top_4_de` — top 4 finishers from group play feed a 4-team DE bracket
- `top_8_de` — top 8 finishers feed an 8-team DE bracket
- `top_N_per_pool_de` — top N from each pool (with crossover seeding) feed a DE bracket

> **Not to be confused with** the standalone `double_elimination` Larger Format (DE-1, DE-2 in the [index](../tournament-formats.md)). That format runs DE on the **full entrant list with no group play**. The variants here run DE only on a **top-N subset after group play** — the bracket mechanics described below apply to both, but the *entrants* are different.

## Concept

In a **single-elimination (SE) playoff**, a single bad match — a fluky game, a bad call, a tweaked ankle — ends a top-seeded team's run. The #1 seed and the #8 seed are equally one loss away from the door.

A **DE playoff** doubles the depth of the bracket. Every team that loses in the **winners bracket (WB)** drops down into a parallel **losers bracket (LB)**, where they can keep playing. A team is only eliminated on their **second** loss. The LB winner advances to the **Grand Final** against the WB winner.

### Why it's worth the cost

- Top seeds get a buffer for one off-game.
- Underdogs who barely survived group play can mount a comeback run through the LB and still win the title.
- The Grand Final is more meaningful: the WB finalist has played an undefeated tournament, the LB finalist has fought back from a loss.

### What it costs

- **Roughly 2x the matches** of an SE playoff for the same entrant count.
- **Longer day** — total clock time is about SE-playoff + 50% (LB rounds run in parallel to WB rounds where possible, so it's not 2x wall time).
- **More complex scheduling** — LB drop-ins depend on WB round completion.

---

## Mechanics — Top 4 DE Playoff (`top_4_de`)

The simplest DE shape. 4 entrants → 3 WB matches + 2 LB matches + 1-2 GF matches = **6-7 total matches**.

### Seeds

Seeds S1, S2, S3, S4 come from group-play standings. See [Seeding & Tiebreakers](./seeding-and-tiebreakers.md) for how rank within a pool, point differential, and head-to-head map to a single linear seed list.

### Bracket structure

- **WSF1**: S1 vs S4 — winners-bracket semifinal 1
- **WSF2**: S2 vs S3 — winners-bracket semifinal 2
- **WF**: WSF1.W vs WSF2.W — winners-bracket final
- **LR1**: WSF1.L vs WSF2.L — losers-bracket round 1 (the two WB semifinal losers)
- **LF**: LR1.W vs WF.L — losers-bracket final
- **GF1**: WF.W vs LF.W — grand final
- **GF2** (optional, only on bracket reset): if LF.W wins GF1, replay

### Grand Final reset (`de_bracket_reset` toggle)

The proposed `de_bracket_reset` flag (see index doc) controls whether GF2 is played:

- **Reset enabled** (default, matches TOC/championship convention): the WB finalist enters GF1 undefeated. If they lose GF1, that's their first loss — GF2 is played to give them a chance at the "must-beat-them-twice" finish. First team to a second loss is eliminated.
- **Reset disabled**: whoever wins GF1 wins, period. Faster but silently demotes the WB finalist's earned buffer to nothing.

The existing trigger [`_advance_double_elim_bracket`](../../supabase/migration_double_elim_advancement.sql) already implements bracket reset (see lines 184-225). Disabling reset would be a column-gated branch around that block.

### Edge: Top-4 DE is symmetric

With exactly 4 teams, LR1 has exactly 1 match (the two WSF losers play each other), and LF has exactly 1 match. There are no "drop-in" rounds — the LB is just two consecutive single matches. This makes Top-4 DE the cleanest variant to test against.

---

## Mechanics — Top 8 DE Playoff (`top_8_de`)

8 entrants → 7 WB matches + 6 LB matches + 1-2 GF matches = **14-15 total matches**.

### Seeds

Standard 1v8, 2v7, 3v6, 4v5 pairings in WB round 1. Quadrants are arranged so the #1 and #2 seeds can only meet in the WB final.

### Bracket structure

**Winners bracket** (3 rounds):
- WB R1 (Quarterfinals): WQF1 = S1 vs S8, WQF2 = S4 vs S5, WQF3 = S2 vs S7, WQF4 = S3 vs S6
- WB R2 (Semifinals): WSF1 = WQF1.W vs WQF2.W, WSF2 = WQF3.W vs WQF4.W
- WB R3 (Final): WF = WSF1.W vs WSF2.W

**Losers bracket** (4 rounds):
- LB R1 (consolidation of WB R1 losers): LR1a = WQF1.L vs WQF2.L, LR1b = WQF3.L vs WQF4.L
- LB R2 (drop-in of WB R2 losers): LR2a = LR1a.W vs WSF1.L, LR2b = LR1b.W vs WSF2.L (the trigger pairs LB-prev winners with WB losers by `match_order`)
- LB R3 (consolidation): LR3 = LR2a.W vs LR2b.W
- LB R4 (drop-in of WB R3 loser, aka LB final): LF = LR3.W vs WF.L

**Grand final**: GF1, optional GF2.

## Mechanics — Top N per Pool DE Playoff (`top_N_per_pool_de`)

Trickier because the entrant count is `P x N` (pools x per-pool) which is not always a power of 2.

### When `P*N` is a power of 2

Seed via **crossover** — top seeds from one pool play lower seeds from the other pool(s), so pool-mates can't meet again until late rounds.

**2 pools, top 2 each (P=2, N=2, total = 4)** — top_4_de shape:
- WSF1: A1 vs B2
- WSF2: B1 vs A2
- ...then standard top-4 DE (see above).

**4 pools, top 2 each (P=4, N=2, total = 8)** — top_8_de shape:
- WQF1: A1 vs D2
- WQF2: B1 vs C2
- WQF3: C1 vs B2
- WQF4: D1 vs A2
- ...then standard top-8 DE.

**2 pools, top 4 each (P=2, N=4, total = 8)** — top_8_de shape:
- WQF1: A1 vs B4
- WQF2: B2 vs A3
- WQF3: B1 vs A4
- WQF4: A2 vs B3
- ...then standard top-8 DE.

The shape on the page is identical to the size-matched top_N_de variant; only the seed labels change.

### When `P*N` is NOT a power of 2

Two options. The index doc flags this as an **open question** — both are reasonable; the pick should be a tournament-time toggle.

#### Option A — Byes for top seeds in WB R1

The top `(next_pow2 - P*N)` seeds get a bye into WB R2; everyone else plays a WB R1 match.

**Example: P=3, N=2, total = 6** (`next_pow2 = 8`, so 2 byes):
- WB R1 (2 matches): the bottom 4 seeds play (S3 vs S6, S4 vs S5)
- WB R2 (2 matches): S1 and S2 enter here, vs WB R1 winners

Pros: simple to implement; mirrors the SE bye scheme.
Cons: byes are LB-asymmetric — a top seed who loses in WB R2 drops into LB R2 (a drop-in round) without having a "consolation pair" partner from LB R1.

#### Option B — Play-in round

A separate **play-in round** (effectively a "WB R0") narrows `P*N` down to the next power of 2 before the real bracket starts.

**Example: P=3, N=2, total = 6** (`next_pow2 = 4`, so 2 play-in matches):
- Play-in (2 matches): S3 vs S6, S4 vs S5 — losers eliminated from playoffs entirely
- Then a standard top_4_de bracket with S1, S2, play-in.W1, play-in.W2

Pros: bracket from WB R1 onward is a clean power of 2.
Cons: play-in losers are eliminated without entering the LB (so they have no consolation path even though they qualified for playoffs); harsh for #5/#6 seeds.

### Recommended default

Pick **Option B (play-in)** for `top_N_per_pool_de` when `P*N` is not a power of 2. It keeps the post-play-in bracket as a clean shape we already have ASCII for, and it matches how most pickleball-league operators run it ("the top 2 from each pool make playoffs; first round is sudden death, then we run a regular bracket").

Revisit if the harshness on #5/#6 seeds becomes a real-world complaint — flipping to byes is a small config change.

---

## Trigger Reuse

**No new trigger is needed for any DE playoff variant.**

The existing trigger [`_advance_double_elim_bracket`](../../supabase/migration_double_elim_advancement.sql) (lines 115-664) already implements every advancement rule used by a DE playoff:

- WB round-to-round advancement (lines 392-440)
- WB-loser → LB drop-in (lines 240-390)
- LB consolidation pairing (lines 597-652)
- LB drop-in pairing waiting on WB completion (lines 511-596)
- WB-final + LB-final → Grand Final creation (lines 442-470, 488-508, 669-757)
- Bracket reset GF2 (lines 184-225)

What the new playoff variants change is **only how the WB round-1 matches are loaded**:

- `top_4_de` / `top_8_de`: insert `round_type='winners'`, `round_number=1` matches with the top-N seeds from group play (linear seed list, standard 1v8/2v7/3v6/4v5-style pairings).
- `top_N_per_pool_de`: same, but with crossover seeding and either byes or a play-in round (see above).

Then let the trigger run. The trigger inspects `format='double_elimination'` (line 155) — the cleanest way to wire this in is to have the format column read `double_elimination` for the playoff phase too (or extend the trigger's `if v_format` check to include the new format strings). Either way, the bracket-walking logic is unchanged.

---

## Edge Cases

### Team withdraws between group play and playoffs

The bracket has been seeded but a team can't show. Two reasonable behaviors — pick at tournament-create time:

- **Substitution**: the next-best seed who didn't make playoffs is promoted to fill the slot (e.g., S9 fills in for a withdrawn S5 in top_8_de). The substitute keeps the withdrawn team's seed position.
- **Forfeit-in-place**: the bracket runs with the slot present but auto-forfeited. The opponent gets a free WB R1 win and drops a phantom loser into LB R1 (which means LB R1 also auto-forfeits on that pairing). This propagates one "free" win up each bracket — workable but ugly.

Substitution is preferred. The trigger doesn't need to know which — substitution happens before WB R1 is loaded.

### WB SF and LB R1 tie on games count

A best-of-N match can produce a tied games count if the tournament uses a non-standard "first to N games" format and both teams reach N-1. Tiebreaker resolution follows the same rules as group play — see [Seeding & Tiebreakers](./seeding-and-tiebreakers.md). The trigger only cares about `winner_team`; it won't fire until the tiebreaker code has stamped a winner.

### Scheduling

A rough wall-clock estimate for the playoff phase:

- **SE playoff** wall time T (single-bracket round-by-round, courts permitting).
- **DE playoff** wall time ≈ **T + 50%**. LB rounds run in parallel with WB rounds where possible (LB R1 plays at the same time as WB R2; LB R3 plays at the same time as WB R3), but the post-WB-final LB tail (LF + GF1 + GF2) adds 2-3 extra match slots that can't parallelize.

If court count is tight (one or two courts) DE will feel closer to 2x SE. With four+ courts and a well-scheduled tournament, the 50% estimate holds.

### What if WB R1 produces an odd loser count?

Only relevant to non-power-of-2 entrant counts (so `top_N_per_pool_de` with byes — Option A). The trigger documents this at lines 295-303 as a known limitation: an unpaired WB R1 loser is dropped from LB. With our recommended **play-in** approach (Option B), the bracket from WB R1 is always a power of 2, so this case never fires.
